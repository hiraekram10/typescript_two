// In cases where programs have complex data structures, 
//using TypeScriptâ€™s basic types may not completely describe
// the data structures you are using. In these cases,
// declaring your own type will help you address the 
//complexity. In this section, you are going create 
//types that can be used to describe any object shape you need to use in your code.

    name: "hira",

//users.push(4) error not accepting any other value except User
// users.push({}) error bcz its keys and values are not same as first
users.push({
